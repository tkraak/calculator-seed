## Getting Started

* clone the seed repository:
  * `git clone https://github.com/tkraak/calculator-seed.git calculator`
  * `cd calculator`
* install project dependencies:
  * `npm install` or `yarn install`
* run the calculator app in your favorite browser at `http://localhost:8080`:
  * `npm start`
* bundle a production build powered by [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
  * `npm run build`

## Optional but Recommended

* push your work to your GitHub account:
  * create a repository named `calculator` on GitHub
  * `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/calculator.git` (ensure that `USERNAME` matches your GitHub username)
  * `git push -u origin master`
* keep your project's tooling up-to-date by periodically pulling from the seed repository (`upstream`):
  * `git remote add upstream https://github.com/tkraak/calculator-seed.git`
  * `git pull upstream master --rebase`
